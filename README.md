# PROJECT-SMART-LIGHT
## Building Smart Light Control With IoT. This project is from Recruitment Assitant Cyber Physical System. We are learning from the basics to put the data from firebase and implement the website and Mobile app with Kotlin. It's fun and exciting because of the program's many trials and errors. But we are successfully building Smart Light Control in 1 month.
